1. Make pan, zoom camera with angle []
2. Make camera follow car in big field, optional angle, make car angle to mouse []
- make cars small and ball big
3. Make car a dot that mouse controls, either move camera when dot goes near screen edge, or make camera follow dot


make rotation work []
get first person cam working []
try making ball roll more []
remove speed multiplier and make new values []
make field 2x as big and easier to pinch []
make player not bounce off wall []
make field lines []

try small car big ball
try mouse bump mode





fix spawns []
fix bumping []

fix kickoff angle []

mess with ball angulardamping and car []

try dribble assist []


update controls and settings []


How bots will work: []
Will start in defend or attack mode by random.
Defend mode:
position self between own goal and ball, then slowly move towards ball
When ball gets closer to bot than player, enter attack mode

Attack mode:
position self behind ball facing player's goal and flip ball into goal.
When player touches the ball, enter defend mode



Make preset game settings presets like only keyboard controls []
Make 1v1 bot with or without same controls as it on home page []



add backwards flip to controls []


make bots leave games and close games []


add boosting to bots: []
if bot is certain distance from car, boost []


Next:

make skill level for bot from 0 to 1 []
add bots to ranked queue []
- every interval, check if player is needed []
- for every player needed, set timeout to have a bot join []
  - fix if player leaves queue before timeout, don't join []

make pinching work by disabling friction on contact []
AT SOME POINT: Fix pinch detected randomly after pinch []


do big test of bot queue []
mess with car friction []




Fix dribbling force []

fix end screen bugs


fix losing control dribbling []



fix player collision []






add setting for non relative movement []





-- OLD --
fix non pointer-disabled settings div
make accounts + fix settings

promote in sideswipe promotion

1v1 someone with plan
- test player pinching
- test if angle or position is disrupted by bumping

fix player pinch detection
Make sure bot boosting is fixed
find a gpt model that can handle the whole project, ask as a professional developer, to rewrite it
add backwardsFlipsUsed to stats page
make kickoffs cycle
add display for ping
get smooth cam working
make ballcam or and ball indicator



-- NEW --
swerveshot
bigger map


angular camera lock mode
- fix jump in rotation from e.deltaX changing []
- tweak settings
- implement perspective shift to make easier to see and see more of map

- add settings for position and angle smoothing

make collisions and weights like RL
make cars weigh more

consider making flip push ball same amount as in rl
and move player same amount

increase flip recharge

goal speed indicator


make color indicator for field sides


switch to pixi
- fix antialiasing
- fix camera
- add renderer back
- try unadjustedMovement = true



fix wall shift to be exact matching physics wall


Fix crazy interpolation glitch
fix perspective mesh

fix resizing window with mesh and container
fix antialias and squiggly lines in perspective mesh


Perspective tilt idea:
- move top left and top right in and down
- make the renderTexture bigger width and height based on in and down amounts
- anchor renderTexture bottom center to screen bottom center
